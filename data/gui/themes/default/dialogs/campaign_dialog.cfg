" + _"campaign_landing^<b>If you’re new to Battle for Wesnoth</b>, we recommend playing our campaigns in the order they’re listed, starting with <span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>The South Guard</span> (which includes an optional tutorial). Each campaign is a separate story, but all are set within the same world. Some characters will appear in more than one, and some characters will have their deeds retold in others." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<b>If you’re a returning player</b>, you’ll notice a number of changes since v1.18..." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>Heir to the Throne</span> has been significantly redesigned, and now features an open world with 33 branching scenarios, each awarding Konrad unique recruits, companions, items, and more. The original HttT is still available as <i>Heir to the Throne, Classic</i>." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>The Deceiver’s Gambit</span> is a new campaign, replacing <i>Delfador’s Memoirs</i>. Follow a young apprentice from Alduin as he fights alongside Wesnoth’s king during a major war against the orcs of the north. Choose between 23 castable magic spells as you bear witness to the fall of Garard and the rise of Asheviere." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>Dusk of Dawn</span> is another new campaign, and is our first troll campaign. Lead the Golden Flame Tribe out from the bowels of Irdya and up to the surface world — but beware what awaits you there." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>Of Pearls and Pirates</span> is a new, beginner-oriented campaign set in a sleepy fishing town on the Bay of Pearls. When corsairs strike, the villagers must join forces with the local merfolk and take the fight to the pirates." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>The South Guard</span> has now replaced <i>Battle Training</i> as our tutorial campaign, offering a more thorough explanation of many game concepts and affording more opportunities in which to practice them. The original <i>Battle Training</i> is still available as part of <i>Heir to the Throne, Classic</i>." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>The Hammer of Thursagan</span> has been revised, with balance, objectives, and map changes to many scenarios, as well as story adjustments and the re-addition of the formerly removed <i>Mages and Drakes</i> scenario." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^<span color='#e1e119' style='italic'>Winds of Fate</span> has been rebalanced with much lower recall costs, gold and enemy changes in many scenarios, and several character and dialogue changes to help tie in better with other campaigns." + "

" + _"campaign_landing^And more! For a full list of changes, consult our official changelog at https://www.wesnoth.org/start/1.20/"
